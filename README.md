Overview

Documentation
-------------

Let's you play a game similar to
[Scorched Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_%28video_game%29).

You are given a RPG which you can use to fire grenades (TNT) to your
opponent using the `/fire` command.

The grenade is sent in the direction you are facing.  Looking up or
down controls the angle of elevation (thus the distance fired).

You can tweak the grenade by optionally specifying an initial _speed_
and a _fuse_ setting.

The game is played with two or more players in different locations in
the map, and they trade shots until only one remains.

WARNING: This game is very destructive to world maps.

### Permission Nodes:

* scorched.cmd.fire - access to the fire command.
