Overview
--------

Let's you play a simulation of the old PC game
[Scorched Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_%28video_game%29).

Commands:

* *rpg* _[fuse speed|short|long|fast]_
* *fire* _[fuse speed|short|long|fast]_

Documentation

*WARNING: This game is very destructive to world maps.*

Let's you play a game similar to
[Scorched Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_%28video_game%29).

You need to have a bow, at least one arrow and as many TNT's as you
can muster.

Equip the bow.  And then enter the command:

	/rpg fast

Activates the RPG with default settings.  Now start shooting your
bow.  Instead of arrows, you will find Primed TNTs.

With this you can play a
[Scorched Earth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_%28video_game%29).
like game.

Looking up or down controls the angle of elevation (thus the distance fired).

You can tweak the grenade by optionally specifying an initial _fuse_
and a _speed_ setting.

The game is played with two or more players in different locations in
the map, and they trade shots until only one remains.

The _fuse_ is the time (in ticks) that the grenade will explode.
Be careful of using very short fuses.  The _speed_ is the initial
speed of the grenade.  Faster means the TNT will travel farther.

### Configuration

	presets:
	  short: [ 30, 0.5 ]
	  long: [ 80, 1.0 ]
	  fast: [ 20, 1.0 ]
	settings:
	  failure: 385
	  rate: 0.5
	  usage: 5
	  max-speed: 4.0
	  min-speed: 0.5
	  max-fuse: 120
	  min-fuse: 10

* `presets` contains config values for the rpg command.
* `failure` is the max damage level for the bow
* `rate` is the chance that the bow will fail
* `usage` is the bow wear and tear
* `max-speed` is the max speed configurable
* `min-speed` is the min speed configurable
* `max-fuse` is the max fuse configurable
* `min-fuse` is the min fuse configurable

### Permission Nodes:

* scorched.cmd.fire - access to commands.

### TODO

* There are two events, ExplosionPrimeEvent for when the entity is
  about to explode and EntityExplodeEvent when actually exploding.
* Catch ExplosionPrimeEvent so we can have an option to disable block
  breaking (setBlockBreaking false)... Anti personel grenade.
  * Needs to add a namedtag to indicate is one of our grenades.
  * EntityExplodeEvent can change the yield?  Mega grenateds?
  * Maybe we can add random cancel to ExplosionPrimeEvent so there is
    a misfired grenade resulting in lying around ordenance.

Changes
-------

* 1.2.0 : Fun and games
  * Bows suffer wear and tear... the more damaged the bow, the higher
    the risk that it will misfired (exploding in your face!)
  * Configurable stuff
* 1.1.0 : Playability improvements
* 1.0.0 : First release
